The Last-Level Branch Predictor (LLBP) is a microarchitectural approach that improves branch prediction accuracy through additional high-capacity storage backing the baseline TAGE predictor. The key insight is that LLBP breaks branch predictor state into multiple program contexts which can be thought of as a call chain. Each context comprises only a small number of patterns and can be prefetched ahead of time. This enables LLBP to store a large number of patterns in a high-capacity structure and prefetch only the patterns for the upcoming contexts into a small, fast structure to overcome the long access latency of the high-capacity structure (LLBP).

LLBP is presented at [MICRO 2024](https://microarch.org/micro57/).

This repository contains the source code of the branch predictor model used to evaluate LLBP's prediction accuracy. The code is based on the [CBP5 framework](http://www.jilp.org/cbp2016/), but was heavily modified and extended with various statistics to evaluate the performance of LLBP and the baseline TAGE predictor.

The aim of this framework is to provide a fast way to evaluate different branch predictor configurations and explore the design space of LLBP. It does *not* model the full CPU pipeline but only the branch predictor.
The framework supports a timing approximation by clocking the predictor for every taken branch and/or more than 8 executed instructions between branches. While we found that this approximation is reasonable accurate to get understand the impact of late prefetches, it is only a rough estimation. For the exact timing the predictor needs to be integrated with a full CPU simulator like ChampSim or gem5.
> We are currently working on integrating LLBP with gem5 and will release the code once it is ready.



## Prerequisites

The infrastructure has been tested with the following system configuration:

* Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
* gcc 11.4.0
* cmake 3.22.1


## Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install cmake
sudo apt install -y cmake libboost-all-dev build-essential pip

# Python dependencies for plotting.
pip install pandas matplotlib ipykernel

```


## Build the project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
cd ..

cmake --build ./build -j 8

```

## Server traces

The traces use to evaluate LLBP collected by running the server applications on gem5 in full-system mode. The OS of the disk image is Ubuntu 20.04 and the kernel version is 5.4.84. The traces are in the [ChampSim](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim) format and contains both user and kernel space instructions. The traces are available on Zenodo at [10.5281/zenodo.13133243](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13133243).

The `download_traces.sh` script in the utils folder will download all traces from Zenodo and stores them into the `traces` directory.:

```bash
./utils/download_traces.sh
```


## Run the simulator

The simulator can be run with the following command and takes as inputs the trace file, the branch predictor model, the number of warmup instructions, and the number of simulation instructions.
The branch predictor model can be either `tage64kscl`, `tage512kscl`, `llbp` or `llbp-timing`.
> The definition of the branch predictor models can be found in the `bpmodels/base_predictor.cc` file.

```bash
./build/predictor --model <predictor> -w <warmup instructions> -n <simulation instructions> <trace>
```

For convenience, the simulator contains a script to run the experiments on all evaluated benchmarks for a given branch predictor model (`./eval_benchmarks.sh <predictor>`).
The results in form of a stats file are stored in the `results` directory. Note, the simulator will print out some intermediate results after every 5M instructions which is useful to monitor the progress of the simulation.


## Reproducing main results (Figure 9)

To reproduce the main results of the paper - the reduction of mispredictions (Figure 9) we provide a separate script (`./eval_all.sh`) that runs the experiments for all evaluated branch predictor models and benchmarks. The script can be run as follows:

```bash
./eval_all.sh
```
The Jupyter notebook (`./analysis/mpki.ipynb`) can be used to parse the statistics file and generate the graph. Open the file and hit `Run All` to generate the graph.



## Code Walkthrough

**Misc:**
* The `main.cc` file contains the main entry point of the simulator. It reads the trace file, initializes the branch predictor model, and runs the simulation.
* The `bpmodel` directory contains the implementation of the TAGE-SC-L and LLBP branch predictor models.

**TAGE:**
* TAGE-SC-L is split into TAGE and SC-L components. The code is taken from the CBP5 framework and modified to include additional statistics to evaluate the branch predictor.
* The only difference of the 512KiB TAGE-SC-L are 8x more entries in the TAGE predictor.

**LLBP:**
* LLBP derives from the TAGE-SC-L base class and overrides several of the methods to implement the LLBP functionality.
* There are two versions of LLBP: `llbp` and `llbp-timing`. Both are functionally the same but the later models prefetching of pattern sets and can be used to study the impact of late prefetches.
* The high-capacity LLBP is called `LLBPStorage` and stores all pattern sets. The `PatternBuffer` is the small, fast structure that stores the patterns for the upcoming contexts.
* The `RCR` class implements all the functionality to compute program context.
